# Basic Setup


### Architecture of naxsi configuration

  * **http {}** level : `include naxsi_core.rules`
  * **server {}** level : 
    * [Dynamic modifiers](runtime-modifiers)
  * **location {}** level :
    * [Enabled/Disabled directives](directives#secrulesenabled)
    * [LearningMode-related directives](directives#learningmode)
    * [Whitelists](whitelists-bnf)
    * [CheckRules](checkrules-bnf)
    * [RequestDenied](requestdenied-bnf)
  * **location /RequestDenied**
    * return HTTP error code, post-processing ...


### Example configuration

```
#Only for nginx's version with modular support
load_module /../modules/ngx_http_naxsi_module.so;
events {
 ...
}
http {
 include /tmp/naxsi_ut/naxsi_core.rules;
 ...
 server {
  listen ...;
  server_name  ...;
  location / {
   #Enable naxsi
   SecRulesEnabled;
   #Enable learning mode
   LearningMode;
   #Define where blocked requests go
   DeniedUrl "/50x.html"; 
   #CheckRules, determining when naxsi needs to take action
   CheckRule "$SQL >= 8" BLOCK;
   CheckRule "$RFI >= 8" BLOCK;
   CheckRule "$TRAVERSAL >= 4" BLOCK;
   CheckRule "$EVADE >= 4" BLOCK;
   CheckRule "$XSS >= 8" BLOCK;
   #naxsi logs goes there
   error_log /.../foo.log;
   ...
  }
  error_page   500 502 503 504  /50x.html;
  #This is where the blocked requests are going
  location = /50x.html {
  return 418; #I'm a teapot \o/
  }
 }
}
```

### Next steps

The next step is learning; however, before jumping there, ensure that you have:
 * A nginx as a webserver or reverse proxy
 * Naxsi installed and running in learning mode
 * If you perform a request such as `curl 'http://127.0.0.1:4242/?a=<>'`, you should see a [NAXSI_FMT](naxsilogs#naxsi_fmt) in your logs :
   `2016/07/12 13:27:04 [error] 14492#0: *1 NAXSI_FMT: ip=127.0.0.1&server=127.0.0.1&uri=/&learning=1&vers=0.55rc2&total_processed=1&total_blocked=1&block=1&cscore0=$XSS&score0=16&zone0=ARGS&id0=1302&var_name0=a&zone1=ARGS&id1=1303&var_name1=a, client: 127.0.0.1, server: localhost, request: "GET /?a=<> HTTP/1.1", host: "127.0.0.1:4242"`


### Learning, log-injection, ElasticSearch, Kibana

The ElasticSearch/Kibana part is optional but provides a great comfort and way to visualize "what's going on".

### Components

Nxtool setup can be found here:
(_tl;dr: python setup.py install, or `./nxtool.py -c nxapi.json -x`_)
  * [nxapi documentation](https://github.com/nbs-system/naxsi/tree/master/nxapi#prequisites)

Kibana (v4 as of this writing) can be downloaded here:
 * [kibana website](https://www.elastic.co/downloads/kibana)

Once those two components are setup, you should be able to inject naxsi logs into ElasticSearch with NxTool.
Here is an example of what it might look like in production:

### Configuration - NXTOOL

As stated in dedicated documentation, nxtool comes with a `json` file specifying ES location, index etc.

```
"elastic" : {
 "host" : "127.0.0.1:9200",
 "index" : "nxapi",
 "doctype" : "events",
 "default_ttl" : "7200",
 "max_size" : "1000",
 "version" : "2"
},
```

Once configured and running on the same host as nginx, you can start injecting logs into ES:

`nxtool.py --fifo /tmp/naxsi_pipe --no-timeout`
_(here, nginx is being told to write logs to /tmp/naxsi_pipe which is a FIFO created by nxtool)_

### Configuration - Kibana

Now, you should be able to configure Kibana to setup a dashboard to visualize your naxsi data.

This step is left as an exercise for the reader, see 
[Creating Kibana Dashboard](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/dashboard.html).



### Configuration - DataDog

Golden Setup 

Blacklisting = mod_security

WAF = naxsi

https://gist.github.com/marcinguy/3a106991d3a84995efacc473f8db21a9

You can get logs to DataDog very easily using this Grok rule:

Grok Parser rule
```
â€‹myParsingrule %{date("yyyy/MM/dd HH:mm:ss"):connect_date} \[%{word:status}\] %{number:id}\#%{number:id2}: \*%{number:value} %{data::json}
```

Then you will see a nice Dashboard of Attacks

You can also send alerts to Slack:

You just built an Open Source WAF solution with Alerts and Dashboard.
