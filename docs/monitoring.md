Munin Plugin
===============

A plugin for munin to monitor the exceptions raised by naxsi is available. It counts the hits by rule id. This way you can prepare in learning mode the WAF and then once a reasonable hit level is reached put it to work.

The [plugin code](https://github.com/patroqueeet/munin-contrib/blob/master/plugins/naxsi_exceptions/naxsi_exceptions) is [pending for being merged](https://github.com/munin-monitoring/munin-plugin-gallery/issues/1](https://github.com/munin-monitoring/munin-plugin-gallery/issues/1) into munin repo.
