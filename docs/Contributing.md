## Contributing to naxsi

We're happily taking patches, contributions, improvements, please see below :

### Naxsi Core Requirements (runtime)

 * Unit tests with a decent (>90%) coverage
 * Peer review by core devs in terms of quality/security impacts
 * For all runtime code, please fuzz the code (see `fuzz` Makefile's target)
 * For all runtime code, merge will require that we get clean static analysis results (coverity)

### NxTool/NxAPI

 * Peer review by other developers
 * General interest for the feature

Thanks in advance !
